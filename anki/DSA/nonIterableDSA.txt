{{c1::Are Trees and Graphs Iterable?}}
- Trees and graphs are {{c1::not inherently iterable}} in their raw form.
- Traversal algorithms are required to iterate through them.

{{c1::Why are Trees not iterable?}}
- Trees are hierarchical structures, {{c1::not linear}}.
- Traversal is needed: {{c1::Depth-First Traversal (pre-order, in-order, post-order)}} or {{c1::Breadth-First Traversal (level-order)}}.

{{c1::How to make Trees iterable?}}
- Implement traversal methods such as pre-order, in-order, or post-order.
- Example: {{c1::Python __iter__ implementation with generator}}

{{c1::Why are Graphs not iterable?}}
- Graphs lack linearity; they depend on the graph type (directed, undirected, etc.).
- Traversal methods are needed: {{c1::Depth-First Search (DFS)}} or {{c1::Breadth-First Search (BFS)}}.

{{c1::How to make Graphs iterable?}}
- Define traversal algorithms and expose iteration interfaces.
- Example: {{c1::Python __iter__ method implementing DFS or BFS}}

{{c1::Tree Example Implementation in Python:}}
```python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value
        self.left = None
        self.right = None

    def __iter__(self):
        if self.left:
            yield from iter(self.left)
        yield self.value
        if self.right:
            yield from iter(self.right)

# Usage:
root = TreeNode(10)
root.left = TreeNode(5)
root.right = TreeNode(15)
for value in root:
    print(value)  # Outputs: 5, 10, 15 (in-order)
