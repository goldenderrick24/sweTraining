/*Sliding Window Technique is a method used to efficiently solve problems that involve defining a window or range in the input data (arrays or strings) and then moving that window across the data to perform some operation within the window. This technique is commonly used in algorithms like finding subarrays with a specific sum, finding the longest substring with unique characters, or solving problems that require a fixed-size window to process elements efficiently.*/
/*How to Identify Sliding Window Problems:
These problems generally require Finding Maximum/Minimum Subarray, Substrings which satisfy some specific condition.
The size of the subarray or substring ‘K’ will be given in some of the problems.
These problems can easily be solved in O(N2) time complexity using nested loops, using sliding window we can solve these in O(n) Time Complexity.
Required Time Complexity: O(N) or O(Nlog(N))
Constraints: N <= 106 , If N is the size of the Array/String.*/

    // n must be greater

    // window and adding last element of
    // current window.
    int window_sum = max_sum;
    for (int i = k; i < n; i++) {
